The Gaming Room is a game producer who previously had success on another gaming application on Andriod OS.
The Gaming Room was looking for me to move their app to multiple other OS systems to reach more costumers.
What I did to help the development process for the gaming room was to write a detailed section in my portfolio
of my recommendations of, security, memory and capacity, different OS, etc.
What I found very useful when it came to understanding the development of this program was using the UML class diagrams.
I found these very useful understanding the clients every need.
If I had to choose one section to revise in my work document, I would choose to go into deeper detail in the OS section.
The section where I explained pros and cons of each OS that the gaming room wanted to explore.
What I would change would to be less broad and focus more on specific advantages and disadvantages based on future discussions
with the client.
It is very important to consider the users needs as it is the clients. The users are who bring in the revenue based on how
many users use this application.
I considered their needs by working to make the speed and transition of the app function properly.
I approached designing this software with an open mind to the Gaming Room needs and focused on what I could do to properly 
display those needs in their application. 
In the future I would take my strategy and hopefully combine it with those of my team as in the future I believe I would be 
working with a group of developers instead of by myself.
